structure of the code

Input states, i.e. for casting a spell we want to have various methods i.e. aiming in a direction, choosing an aoe target,
selecting an entity
Then handing ui input

Abilities and spells
should be able to handle many variations i.e. projectiles channelling spells direct target spells dot's
Effects cover a lot of this

//TODO:: How are we handling the Group class in a manager, i.e. active entities, local entities, tile chunk?
