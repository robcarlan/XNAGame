Ideas for the hero:
	Exp gain :- level of xp needed grows per level
		gained xp is multiplied by a factor calculated by difference between levels.

Combat Skills:
	-Faith
		Healing skill, after a certain threshold in faith a light is created underneath the player, which grows in strength
		as the faith skill increases (light is important, especially in dungeons). (Possibly unlocked via talent)
	-Agility
		Increases base speed slightly

Abilities:
	-Ability effectiveness is increased at certain levels


Talents:
	-Multiple trees
	-Chosen on playstyle
	-One is chosen early in the game, more can be chosen as the player progresses. Another tree can be selected, which creates
	a hybrid character, or the main tree can be developed further than normal (for pure characters)
	-Talents unlock new abilities, or enhance the players skills which are relevant to the tree
	- A tree is chosen 

	Possible tree styles:
		Strength / Melee combat
			Base tree for any melee combat.
			-Allows competent use of shield / melee weapons
		Agility / Ranged combat 
			Agility is used primarily for archers
			-Unlocks poisons
			Hybrid with strength for a rogue / ranger character
		Offensive Magic
			Caster tree, used primarily for DPS
			-Unlocks base set of damage spells
				-Development could lead to specialisation in certain magic schools
			Hybrid with Agility yields magic arrow spells (Physical + Magic damage)
			Hybrid with strength gives magic infused weapons 
		Healing Magic
			Caster tree, used for a priest playstyle
			-Unlocks base healing spells / magical enhancements / light based spells
				-Development largely beneficial in multiplayer
		Manipulation Magic ( Similar to red magic )
			Caster tree, not used directly for damage
			-Unlocks set of spells:
				-Shields
				-Enhancements
				-Slow effects
				-Summoning?

Non-Combat skills:
	-Used to help in combat situations and non combat
	-Can be used to make money
	-Alchemy
		-Potions and consumables will be very beneficial
