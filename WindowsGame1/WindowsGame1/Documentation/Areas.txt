Each area has a general level zone
Each area often has secret / extra parts which require a much harder level to enter
Some areas should be suited towards different playstyles, i.e. a magic cavern for versatility
Upon defeating one rare area, the rewards should make it possible to defeat the next more difficult area
At night, enemy levels increase to a minimum (so night travel is near impossible before this), and higher levelled enemies 
will appear for that level zone. 
Unique spawns vary in level, but are generally very difficult (similar to hel reaver)

The difficult random spawns (i.e. dark souls wandering black knights) should be indicated by a spooky message similar to
castlevania (what a terrible night ot have a curse) wow so spooky
