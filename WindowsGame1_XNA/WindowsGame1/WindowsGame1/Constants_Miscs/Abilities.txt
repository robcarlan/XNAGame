Requirements, i.e. needs weapon / shield / bow / staff

QTE's several spells have qte-like hotspots that make the ability much better.
i.e. holding down a spell and releasing at the exact time it finishes casting will increase damage / reduce mana use
Firing a bow when it flashes increases damage (similar to bastion)
Blocking an attack when it is about to hit you will grant temporary immunity / resistance
