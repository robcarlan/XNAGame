Sets of equipment for each combat style. Divided into general tiers, which become harder to acquire, but better
Multiple sets for the same combat style, each with different bonuses. i.e more mana / more spell power
each item drop has a generated quality, similar to terraria. Higher quality becomes increasingly rare, so the player will 
never have a full set of the best quality gear.
