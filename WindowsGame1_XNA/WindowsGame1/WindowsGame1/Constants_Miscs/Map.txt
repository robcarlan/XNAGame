Ideal features for main map
	Volcanic region
	Ghost town / destroyed city
	Snowy region
	Desert
	Felds
	Forest
	islands
	Lake
	Areas taht are difficult to reach - barred off by mountains, 
	only reachable by dangerous route
	i.e. mines of moria!
	Gothic region like canifis
	Narrow Pass

	Multiple continents - DLC Lol!

Ideal mechanics
	Multiple factions , one big city for the 'empire' faction, and one smaller one for the other faction
	Multiple sub factions, i.e. independent cities
	Some port towns for travel
	All cities somewhat connected, but are dangerous to travel between at night

IDEA	
	Large portion of the map is destoryed / deserted. This is where all the dangerous enemies roam, but where the story items are 
	mainly located. Delving further into the abandoned area opens new shortcuts back to the main hub of the dangerous location

	One area is a safe haven for ost of the game, i.e. rebel hideout. But it gets taken over by bad guys and becomes dangerous
