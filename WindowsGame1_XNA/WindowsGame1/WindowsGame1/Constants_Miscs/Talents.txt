Alchemy:
	Potions can be mixed together to increase their potency, providing they are of the same type. The more potions which are 
	mixed together, the slower the potency will increase (i.e subsequent potions will grant 0.5*, then 0.25*...). 
	All potions can increase to a maximum potency.

Slayer:
	A slayer hall is located in the (probably far east) town. It is initially near empty, and requires you to defeat certain
	enemies to fill it up with trophies. Some tasks require gathering certain lures for enemies, various hunting, and 
	sometimes teamwork to defeat large bosses. This skill will introduce you with the skills required to beat \ engage
	end game bosses. 
	Could unlock - bestiary, agility skills to access new areas
